# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
#### The purpose of this analysis is to research who and how many employees will be retiring and how many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill. This in result will also find out which employees are eligible for the retirement package.

## Results: 
#### Four major points from the two analysis deliverables:
#### - Out of the 90,398 retiring employees 57,668 of them are Senior Engineer and Senior Staff
#### - Out of the 90,398 retiring employees only 2 hold the Manager title
#### - Only 1,549 retiring employees have mentorship eligibilty out of the 90,398 retiring employees
#### - Production, Development and Sales are the departments Pewlett Hackard needs to look into deeply regarding a hiring process right away

## Summary: 
#### Once the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact precisely 90,398 positions will need to filled, within that count 1,549 of them are mentor eligible.
 
#### There is not enough qualified retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation. The best advice I would say is to develop a program or some sort of training for the new generation to get promoted quickly and effeciently to fill the roles as well as start marketing to hire experienced individuals. Within that time create a program to develop more qualified retirement-ready employees in each department and pursue the training consistently so that way a similar occurance like the "silver tsunami" would not occur during the time when future generations are present.
